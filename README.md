# ConCurrency

ConCurrency is a console application designed to facilitate currency exchange operations from the cashier's perspective. The project was developed as part of the final, group project during the "For us IT's possible" project by me and 3 other participants. It allows the exchange of various currencies and the storage of transaction data.

## Features

- Currency exchange: enables purchase, sale, and exchange of foreign currency.
- Data storage: loads and saves cash register balances and currency exchange rates to JSON files.
- User authentication: cashiers can be authenticated using a username and password.
